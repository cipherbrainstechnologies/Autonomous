# Authentication Bypass - Development Mode

## Status

Authentication has been **temporarily disabled** due to ongoing issues with the `streamlit-authenticator` library.

## Why Authentication is Disabled

1. **Version 0.4.2**: Has a bug causing `"string indices must be integers, not 'str'"` error during password validation
2. **Version 0.2.3**: Has API compatibility issues and different method signatures
3. The library's password validation logic has persistent bugs across versions

## Current Behavior

- ✅ Dashboard loads directly without login
- ✅ User is automatically set as "Admin"
- ⚠️ Warning shown in sidebar: "Authentication disabled - Development mode"
- ✅ All dashboard features are accessible

## To Re-Enable Authentication

1. Wait for library fixes or use a working version
2. Uncomment the authentication code in `dashboard/ui_frontend.py` (lines 106-195)
3. Uncomment the `import streamlit_authenticator as stauth` line
4. Uncomment the logout button call

## Security Note

⚠️ **WARNING**: This bypass should **ONLY** be used for:
- Development/testing
- Local development environment
- **NOT for production** - Always enable authentication in production!

## Re-Enabling Steps (Future)

When ready to re-enable:

1. Find a stable version of `streamlit-authenticator` that works
2. Uncomment all code between `# ===================================================================` markers
3. Test authentication flow
4. Ensure `secrets.toml` has valid credentials
