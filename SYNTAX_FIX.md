# Syntax Error Fixed - ui_frontend.py

## Issue
```
SyntaxError: expected 'except' or 'finally' block
File: dashboard/ui_frontend.py, line 346
```

## Problem
The outer `try` block starting at line 245 (in the Backtest tab) was missing its corresponding `except` or `finally` clause. The inner `try` block (line 289) had an `except`, but the outer one didn't.

## Solution
Added the missing `except` block for the outer `try` statement to handle CSV loading errors:

```python
        except Exception as e:
            st.error(f"❌ Error loading CSV file: {e}")
            st.exception(e)
```

## Structure Now Fixed

```python
if uploaded_file is not None:
    try:  # Outer try - handles CSV loading
        # Load and process CSV data
        # ...
        if st.button("▶️ Run Backtest"):
            try:  # Inner try - handles backtest execution
                # Run backtest
                # ...
            except Exception as e:  # Inner except
                st.error(f"❌ Backtest failed: {e}")
        
    except Exception as e:  # Outer except - NOW ADDED
        st.error(f"❌ Error loading CSV file: {e}")
else:
    st.info("ℹ️ Please upload a CSV file...")
```

## Verification
✅ Syntax check passed - file now compiles correctly

## Next Steps
You can now run the dashboard:
```powershell
.\run_local.ps1
```

Or:
```powershell
python -m streamlit run dashboard/ui_frontend.py
```
